Danger Logs

Exception Guarantees:

Sometimes the client may send invalid request, for which we should return 404 URL not found.

For sockets, when creating, binding, listening and accepting new connections, these actions may fail. We wrap each of them with try...catch... and pass
any exception to higher-level functions, where these exceptions will be properly processed (either quit with error or retry).


Mar.03.2021:

The user may send other protocols like FTP, SFTP and etc. Our proxy server may not be able to process them, 
thus may cause the result website appears differently.

HTTP may require "long TCP connection" via header "connectivity: keep-alive", we need to take this situation into consideration.

Mar.06.2021:

Time value may not be in the GMT format. 

We create a new thread each time out socket "accepts" a new socket request. It is bad since too many connection request
may cause the proxy server to run into OutOfMemory or StackOverflow. Instead we created a fixed thread pool to handle this situation.
The fixed thread pool only create a certain number of threads (e.g. 50) for handling requests, which protects the system.
However this may increase the response latency from a user's perspective. We may build a cluster with a load balancer in the front to solve this problem
in the real industry.
